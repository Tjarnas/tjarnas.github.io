                <h2>How I can contribute</h2>
                <p>I bring a rare combination of technical skill and project management expertise that allows me to deliver exceptional results. Not only can I craft responsive, user-friendly web applications with cutting-edge technologies like React, HTML5, and CSS3, but I also excel at coordinating with teams, meeting deadlines, and aligning technical work with business goals. I thrive on solving complex problems, adapting quickly to new tools and challenges, and ensuring every project exceeds expectations. My social skills have been a strong asset throughout my career. I’ve always valued building relationships, whether it’s with team members, clients, or stakeholders, and I believe in creating a collaborative and supportive work environment.</p>
                <ul id="highlights">
                    <span>Here are some highlights:</span>
                    <li><b>Communication:</b> I excel at breaking down technical concepts into clear, understandable terms for different audiences. This has been key in roles like project management and partner advising.</li>
                    <li><b>Teamwork:</b> I thrive in team settings, whether it’s collaborating with developers to deliver solutions or working cross-functionally to meet client expectations.</li>
                    <li><b>Problem-solving under pressure:</b> I handle challenges with a calm, proactive approach, helping teams focus and find solutions efficiently.</li>
                    <li><b>Empathy and adaptability:</b> I connect easily with people, understanding their perspectives and adjusting my communication style to build trust and ensure smooth collaboration.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>My Experience</h2>
                <p>I’ve spent most of my career in tech-focused roles, spanning from customer service and project management to partner advising and service management. Over the years, I’ve worked at companies like Dstny Sweden AB, Klarna, Soluno BC, and Hi3G Access AB.</p>
                <ul id="experienceList">
                    <li>At <b>Dstny Sweden AB</b> I’m currently a Project Manager, where I coordinate technical solutions and ensure high-quality service delivery for cloud-based communication systems.</li>
                    <li>At <b>Klarna</b> I supported technical teams in delivering integrations and maintaining product quality for e-commerce solutions.</li>
                    <li>My time at <b>Soluno BC</b> allowed me to dive deeper into partner advising, project management, and service management, implementing VoIP solutions and driving technical support for complex issues.</li>
                    <li>At <b>3 (Hi3G Access AB)</b> I worked in customer service and sales support, where I improved customer satisfaction and coordinated technical migration projects.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>On top of that, I’ve recently completed a Front-end Developer course at Beetroot Academy. I gained hands-on experience with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and tools like Git, Sass, and Webpack. It’s fueled my passion for building responsive and user-friendly web applications, which aligns with my goal of transitioning into a dedicated frontend development role.</p>
